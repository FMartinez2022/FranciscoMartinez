        <p>Website 1: old.reddit.com</p>
        <p> Is the page appealing or unappealing? I find the page for old.reddit.com to be appealing due to it's simplicity, it's design is straight foward and to the point, I know where everything is and where it will take me, and it is not difficult to discover new topics within the website.</p>
        <p>Would you encourage others to visit this website? Yes I would. I feel that this version of reddit is the superior version of the website because the newer version is more focused on working with mobile devices and in turn lessens the desktop experience.</p>

        <p>Website 2: wwww.reddit.com</p>
        <p>Is the page appealing or unappealing? I find the newer version of reddit to be unappealing. I find it to be unappealing due to it being (in my opinion) too busy, there are also ads that sneak their way onto your feed and are intentially made to be difficult to spot, and finally it can be infuriating to try to go back and find a previous post only for it to disappear and be difficult to relocate.</p>
        <p>Would you encourage others to visit this website? No I would not. As mentioned previously, I feel that this newer version of reddit sacrifices usability for it's desktop viewers to pander to mobile users in a similar way that Microsoft botched the experiment that was Windows 8 by trying to make the desktop experience more like mobile. </p>
